# EEG-Based-Motor-Imagery-Classification-Right-Hand-vs.-Right-Foot-
Developed EEG-based motor imagery classifiers for right hand vs. right foot imagery using BCI Competition III Dataset IVa, applying CSP + LDA for five subject-specific models (trained independently) and FBCSP + LDA for cross-subject classification using combined data from all subjects.
